Welcome! My name is Nate Ngo and I am currently the performance analyst for the USA Men's Indoor National Volleyball Team where I handle video and data analysis. I have been learning and implementing the statistical programming language R since 2016, and am a strong advocate for its use in how we analyze and present information within the sport. In sharing some of my thoughts, processes, and code through this site, I hope to inspire future analysts in the sport of volleyball, and future fans from the data world (and beyond!).

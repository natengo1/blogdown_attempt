      <description>NCAA Men’s Volleyball RostersAfter a bit of a hiatus, I’m back with a project I’ve been working on recently - accumulating men’s volleyball rosters from team sites. This exercise has been a good introduction to web scraping using the {rvest} package as well as data cleaning, particularly using the unite() and separate() functions from {tidyr}, working with strings using str_squish() from {stringr} and gsub(). During this process, I started to get curious about plotting points with maps as to visualize where college men’s volleyball players were coming from.</description>

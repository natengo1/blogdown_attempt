      <description>USAV Tech AcademyIn case you haven’t heard, for the last three days, USA Volleyball hosted a series of webinars geared towards the data/analytics/technology side of the game which we called the USAV Tech Academy. I, alongside a number of people I feel fortunate to call friends and colleagues, presented and spoke on a range of topics in this realm. If you’re interested in listening to these presentations, you can register ($20 cost) through the previous link and you’ll have access through the end of 2020.</description>
